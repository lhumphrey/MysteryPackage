# MysteryPackage
A "mystery" package in SPARK/Ada

Tip: you can try this out on learn.adacore.com by hijacking one of their interactive examples, 
e.g. https://learn.adacore.com/labs/intro-to-ada/chapters/solutions.html#months
However, you will need to change the name of 'Mystery_Package' to 'Months' to work with interactive example template.

You can also get the necessary SPARK/Ada compilers, IDE, etc. at https://www.adacore.com/download (x86 GNU Linux).
